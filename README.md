# KoggeStoneAdder

It is a high sepped 4 bit adder. Its fastest as it do some levels of parallel computaion. So, the speed is very distinct from RCA. But, its true worth will be clearly seen with higher number of bits. For just four bit, speed is not that noteworthy.

#Future Plan:
Make this adder parametrised!
